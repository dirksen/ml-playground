        "\n",
        "When watching Youtube vidoes on hot-button topics, I would often deep dive into the comments section to look for good arguments and counter arguments. Youtube organize the comments section into two levels: top level comments that address to the video, and replies to those comments. Often I found good debates among these reply threads that brought fresh angles and insights. Unfortunately, Youtube's UI make it very difficult to dig up good debates:\n",
        "1. Youtube doesn't sort comments by the number of replies. I have to scroll and skip a lot of comments of zero replies just to access the reply threads.\n",
        "2. Not all threads present good debates. Many of them are one-sided, like mini-echo-chambers. It's time consuming to read tens of replies only to find out there isn't much debate going in the thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook attempts to mine good debates from the video comment threads, by using Youtube API to scrape top N most replied comment threads, and then use ChatGPT API to rank them. It will render the threads at the end for easy reading."

Progressives aren't the ones trying to suppress the Black vote. Voting is the largest voice any one can have in any society. Blacks are not liberal. Liberals attach themselves to the Black cause and not the other way around. Blacks do not reject liberals because it makes for a larger voting block. It is the republicans who are doing the gerrymandering and vote suppressing. They also, when they have the power to do so close polls where they know people aren't going to vote for them. Mainly in districts with large Black populations. Blacks as a whole are mainly conservative, but they are pushed out of conservative circles, because of their race and also because they are mainly poor. If republicans weren't so racist republicans would have hardly anyone to oppose them, but racism is what they run on and it has actually killed their party. The only way republicans will win from now on is to suppress the vote. Even if they succeed in doing that elections will be overturned and reversed in court proceedings. Bryan Kemp of Georgia will not win another election. They will start switching parties so they can be elected. Those two democrats who voted against trump's impeachment are really republicans in disguise. They will not win another election as a democrat.

Most white people alive today are not anti-black racists, whereas, a lot of these anti-white radicals people running around are directly anti-MLK (note that the co-founder of Black Lives Matter admitted on camera that they are 'trained Marxists'), and the entire post-modernist, Marxian ideology is anti-MLK, fundamentally. Also, a lot of white people over the last 40 years have been praising MLK and his overall vision and way of action. The key point is that a lot of black people are now anti-MLK today. But, again, many white people are pro-MLK today, and they are not the same white people from 60 years, let us be clear; therefore, it doesn't matter how many people were anti-MLK at the time -- which was most, yes, but not all. Don't forget, you saw all types of people in the 1960s from white, black-loving hippies to literal KKK members, to decent, normal black people to Marxist, anti-white black racists, or black Muslim anti-white racists, and everybody in between. See Ali, for example, circa 1965, or X (though Ali did heavily change his views later in life). Compare this to MLK, and compare him to the black, anti-white, woke, post-modernist, Marxist BLM organisations and cults running around. Beyonce herself donated 1 million dollars to BLM and made an entire album that was 'white people bad, France evil, black people good' back in 2018 or so, all because she is like 20% French and France used to have slaves 200 years ago, so she thinks she has some kind of connection to slaves and knows best regarding the evil white Western world and thinks the West's art and history is 'too white/European' -- and let's not forget that every nation on Earth had slavery and every people on Earth until the English, and the English alone, ended it, starting around 800 years ago, and ending around 200-250 years ago, which was also followed by the Americans, French, and otherwise by the 1800s -- yet nobody else, and still much of the world has slavery. Alas, despite the fact Beyonce is middle-class, hyper-rich, from Texas with pretty middle-class, semi-famous parents, and has no connection at all to France, Africa, or slaves from 200 years ago; in fact, slavery was illegal on mainland France from the 1700s or something, so they made quite big leaps in this regard.

              "Just to Add more insult to injury’ it literally meant that the children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and great great grandchildren of slaves” were forced to unknowingly pay out compensation to the families of Slave Owners for over a period of 200 years directly through their taxes up until 2015..~ PRICELESS!’ So It’s OK 👌 to pay Compensation to Dead Slave Owners & their Families £308 Billion over a 200 yr period?

Honestly, with everything going on, I see it as raw tribalism in action. I don't think either side is immune to this evolutionary instinct, It's a human thing, not a left vs. right thing at all. I'm fairly certain at this point if social order breaks down catastrophically, we'll have tribalism to blame.

I learned of the possibility of being on the libertarian left because of the four quadrant model that you can roughly plot one's political orientation on. It's popularly called the \"political compass\" because rather than the familiar X axis only left - right model, it also includes the up - down Y axis. The upper two quadrants being authoritarian (the easiest examples to cite for the upper left would be the Soviet Union, and the upper right would be Nazi Germany), and the lower two quadrants being libertarian. I fall solidly on the lower left. I'm assuming you fall on the lower right someplace. In my mind, the authoritarian/libertarian distinction is FAR more important than the traditional left/right distinction. Because in my mind, individual liberties are the most important value that we have to defend. If we lose our individual liberties, then honestly fiscal concerns don't matter much. Once we have established our individual liberties and are prepared to defend them together, then we can negotiate all the rest. So basically, considering the value I place on individual liberty, anyone sharing my anti-authoritarianism stance is essentially on my team, left or right. I have no animus for anyone on the right as long as they're anti-authoritarian. Whereas, though I am on the left, I consider those on the authoritarian-left to be my ideological enemies, and I have plenty to say about them..\n",

So my question is, how is the right going to react? And if all hell breaks loose, what kind of state will the right want to establish? There are authoritarians on the right too, and though they might go on and on about \"freedom\", but it's their idea of freedom, not my (and probably not your) idea of freedom.

And this most certainly includes me. One of my most liberating  (and humbling) moments was when I was able to look back on a former version of myself and realized I had been a semi-zealot against organized religion. I still have little good to say about religion, but eventually I was able to stop foaming at the mouth, step back, and breathe a little. I was seeing proof all around me of the evils of religion. Why? Not because it was there necesarily, but because I was frantically searching for it. Did I find some of it? Sure, some. Did I find quite a lot that was probably not what I thought it was at the time? Absolutely. I'm a fairly intelligent person, and I was back then too (though about 15 years younger) but I was still duped by my own worst instincts. I like to think I've learned a lesson.

People on both sides of this argument have drunk the cool aid from their own team.  Coleman, indeed, may be slightly more nuanced than some of the rabid conservatives out there.  My personal position is I think the conservative side dramatically undervalues the intensely deep harm that Slavery + Jim Crow + Redlining + ubiquitous prejudice and discrimination in things like employment and housing have caused, and that there is a lack of recognition that all of these harms are compounding in a way that drives a large proportion of the wealth gap between blacks and whites.  Indeed, within-race class and to some degree as coleman says, cultural ethos, play a role in this, but I think conservatives need to recognize that 400 years of oppression has an EFFECT on culture in a way that will be detrimental to that culture.  In so many ways, Black people have fought and made significant strides towards self-determination (reconstruction, civil rights battles, etc) and that has always been deeply a part of black culture.  But when you run up against a power structure that relegates you by race and skin tone over and over and over, well it can affect the way the culture evolves.  I do believe in self-reliance and working hard.  Those are so important and can better the lives of individuals, and they should be emphasized.

In my view the fundamental flaw of the conservative argument is that it gravely undervalues the intensely deep harm that slavery + jim crow + redlining + ubiquitous discrimination in housing, employment and policing have caused black people, and how these harms have a compounding effect in a society. Indeed, as Coleman points out within-race class and things like cultural ethos do play a role as well, and should be included in the conversation.  But to not also realize that 400 years of oppressive measure brought to bear upon a people by a government will have an EFFECT on a culture.  Black people have a long history of self-determination and self-sufficiency (reconstruction era, civil rights battles during the 19th and 20th century), but running up against a power structure, principally organized by skin tone, over and over and over that seeks to oppress you will leave its mark on a culture.  I do believe in self-reliance and in working hard, and believe that both of those can cause someone to better their lot in life.  There are truths on both sides of this argument.  But the much larger fallacy is to undervalue the ways in which 400 years of oppressive policies bear upon the explanation in disparities between racial groups.

Part of that change, however, should including electing more Blacks to public office as what once happened in the days right after the Civil War.  Unfortunately, the Jim Crow south and northern conservatives made sure fewer and fewer Black men were elected to public office.  It's why today we only have 3 Blacks Senators (which is where the real congressional power lay) and some 40 House Representatives.  Granted, that's probably a historic number of Black House Representatives, but that's not where the real power resides. (2020-09-17T17:23:37Z)</li><li>@thomassandler5052: You are a bulls%#t liar!

Whether you are for or against reparations being paid out there is no denying the “grounds” for doing so. As I’ve mentioned before, H.R. 40 does not grant reparations. It’s a bill that would grant a “Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans.” A lot of advocates for reparations including myself think that reparations should be limited to the descendants of slaves as opposed to all Black Americans. Nevertheless, the bill doesn’t actually issue reparations, it simply commissions a committee to further research and develop the case. \n",

In 2020 Germany extended Holocaust compensation to include survivor spouses. I recognize that this fact doesn’t support my argument because I’m now introducing other governments and these situations would NOT count as precedent as seen by our legal system.

A Virginia court found that a black farmer owned a black individual despite his writ of indentured servitude being timed out, which at the time was how all races of poor people were treated to gain entrance into the colonies. Where ta'nahasi  failed in his argument for reparations was that he was emotional , he didn't bring facts as to how exactly reparations would play out in advancing blacks living in America. It's an emotional topic that needs a logical argument. We're going to use x amount to assist in home purchase/down payment, x amount for purchasing land so blacks can have their own vegetables, x amount to startup and retain black owned businesses etc.. How would these actions positively affect and effect the community, the city, the state, the country. Don't forget this is a capitalist society and a capitalist country, it's run as a business first and foremost, if it doesn't make fiscal sense they'll sweep it under the rug. They're both intelligent individuals with compelling argument but at the end of the day neither really had the edge, going by just the clip and not the entire hearing. I wrote out a rough draft of reform for the government and law enforcement years ago yet still haven't figured out how to make it fiscally viable so it's dead in the water just like reparations. Only 300 thousand some Africans were brought to the colonies, it doesn't make sense to not have an active and long standing plea/demand for the rest of the nations who utilized African slaves for labor.

Remember, before there was an option to go to America, slavers who understood that their slaves were Muslim would have realized that nobody would buy them, so they would have just killed them on the road to the markets.

Is there anything about the systemic oppression that makes it so they cannot possibly succeed *in spite* of the advantages they might enjoy from their social status? The question can be asked to countless *millions* of black people and the answer will remain the same. Therefore, these disadvantages are no longer relevant on a group level.\n",

Certainly, if a systemic problem is large enough, there will be enough popular support to see a significant change. This was true for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \n",

              "Think about what that means. \n",
              "Before the slave trade, male slaves had lower value. They were more difficult to handle on the road and if they were castrated before they were taken to the Middle East slave markets, they would have had to travel, presumably largely on foot while injured. \n",
              "If 2/3 and 3/4 of the slaves were women, *what happened to the men*? The simple answer is that they *died*. They died in battle defending their villages. They died en route. They died from infection after being castrated (probably a relatively low percentage admittedly since simple castration is not the most invasive procedure). They would have been left on the side of the road to die if food supply was a problem. \n",
              "And there was always the chance that the men would convert to Islam when they got there. This would mean that they could no longer be slaves. This is different for women of course, because their fate would be largely unchanged regardless of religious conversion or being a slave - they were still used as concubines and sex objects to raise more children. Even as a wife under Islam, they had few liberties more than a slave. But the men converting would have been a problem that lowered their value even further since they could no longer fetch a price as an actual slave. They might be able to find employment in the same types of work (manual labor and meat shields in combat), but if they could not be sold as a slave, they would not provide any financial benefit to the slave traders. They likely would also not have been declared as slaves sold in the slave trade (skewing the numbers we have today).\n",
              "An odd irony is the fact that if male slaves were just killed rather than taking them as slaves to the Islamic slave markets, especially if they were likely to convert or already exposed to Islam, this would have decreased significantly with the start of the Atlantic slave trade. The slave markets in the Americas didn't care what religion you said you were, you could still be sold as a slave. So slave traders would have started to send their male slaves over to the Atlantic coast instead of just killing them. This is especially true if male slaves had a higher value than females, which appears to be the case. An ugly irony to be sure.\n",
              "It is quite obvious then that the cost of human lives from slavery in the Islamic slave trade was tremendously higher than it looks. If men and women are born in roughly equal numbers, then the available pool of humans from which slaves were taken would have been roughly equal. So even discounting the casualties from war, there's a massive disparity in numbers here.\n",
              "To get 750,000 female slaves and 250,000 male slaves (as indicated by the percentages), just the basic math would suggest that there were still 750,000 males available, with 500,000 *not taken*. The most likely fate for these 500,000 was death. They never would have shown up on a slave trader's ledger, but that doesn't erase the fact that they died.\n",
              "Now this is not an established idea, but it does work for common sense. We do also know that there were a LOT of people who died that never made it to slave markets, so the number of slaves that were sold is *vastly* understating the level of death and suffering as a result.\n",
              "For the Atlantic slave trade, it has been suggested that for every slave that left the shores of Africa, between 4 and 7 people died. I cannot imagine that this is a smaller number for the Islamic slave trade, which had numbers strongly suggesting massive casualties and had much lower technology/slower methods of transporting slaves to the markets for at least a large portion of the time it was in operation.\n",
              "It is estimated that for large periods of time, around 50% of the deaths on the African continent were from war. These wars were mostly carried out by warlords collecting slaves for the slave trade. \n",

Coates is not really hyperfocused \n",

So Coates brings up an idea of applying this to the government, which does not effectively die, so is not subject to the concept of vicarious punishment. The first objection to that is that the government is in fact generational and the people that would provide monies paid would be the people of the US. The second objection to that is the redemption argument I referenced quite a ways up there, where the generation currently represented by the US government is 2-4 or even 5 generations beyond that which *ended slavery*. So the third objection here is an objection on moral grounds. If it is on moral grounds, you're outside the scope of US law. Hence, principle and looking at parties outside of the US. This is also important because we're getting into the distinction between companies that operated the slave trade and individuals who owned slaves. Individuals that owned slaves are long since dead and we do not have a legal precedent for vicarious punishment. The government is also not  responsible for illegal actions of its people, so anything after the emancipation cannot be applied to the US government. Companies that operated the Atlantic slave trade were not distinctly within the US government as international affairs and in many cases, operating well before the formation of the US government. \n",

Slavery was ended via the emancipation proclamation on January 1, 1863. The Civil War was between states, some of which did not accept this, but were ultimately defeated by 1865. A series of amendments and adjustments to the law took place over the following few years as well under Grant, some of which were watered down and walked back a bit later. \n",

It is difficult to build an argument that generational slavery was a huge issue for slavery within the scope of 74 years, especially when the period since 1863 is twice as long, so in order to make that argument, you either need to look outside of the strict US government or deal with the fact that for 2/3 of the time the US government has existed, it has been the leading government in the world on ending slavery and build your argument for reparations on slaves who were slaves during those 74 years. You would then have to make reparations only to the families directly affected by the actions within those 74 years and then further demonstrate that nothing was actually paid (welfare arguments). I don't see anyone making these types of arguments. I see broad, sweeping generalizations - or at the very least, broad, sweeping generalizations being applied over top of those who argue for the more specific argument you appear to be trying to make. \n",

There is an ethics argument to be made here, but if you want to keep it to strict legal terms of reparations, this cannot apply, as you have stated above - emotional arguments etc... if you want to make a legal argument against the US government, then it has to be policy based. If you want to add \"ramifications\", then you have a much more difficult legal argument to make. \n",

This allows for the extension to the earlier time of 1619, which is not an argument for reparations against the US government. Coates has been associated with this line of argument. It's a problem because this is arguing for a legal compensation from an entity before it existed. Coates tried to apply cross-generational culpability on the grounds that the US government is not a person or private business with a limited existence. This is a self-defeating argument. If the relief is sought from companies, but those companies are no longer in existence, then you don't get relief. The government is not liable for the actions of companies simply because they have a legal system that means that when the company is gone, there's no money to be redistributed. \n",

Descendants of the Holocaust, Japanese internment camp survivors, Natives receiving payment, land and reservation casinos. I find this downshift and lack of willingness to even discuss such things among Americans when it comes to blacks. What I have also noticed is when those other groups received their reparations, no one outside those specific groups had any say so because it was kept private and quiet. I believe anti reparation media outlets only make our fight so public is because they believe it will be less likely to happen with most whites not being in support of it. I believe that should be irrelevant when it comes to the government paying a debt. I would ask for all tax exemptions, stock in any corporation that had ties to slavery, and business grants. That's what I want to see happen. (2020-07-14T02:15:51Z)</li><li>@eschelar: @@HBIC917 I like the type of provisions you are talking about here. \n",

The most well known is the program that provides cash assistance to families with dependent children—defined as families in which one or both parents are not present—currently called the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program and called Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) prior to 1996. The AFDC program was created by the Social Security Act in 1935. It originally provided benefits primarily to poor widows, but in the 1960s. More important in both dollar and caseload terms today are the programs providing noncash benefits to low-income families. These include Food Stamps, Medicaid, low-income housing assistance, and a host of other programs including job training, Head Start, and a variety of food assistance programs other than Food Stamps. By one authoritative account, there are upwards of 80+programs in the United States providing cash or noncash assistance to low-income families.

What both you and Coates do is point out that clearly this system has a dark history, and therefore *all problems that plague the black community have the system to blame, and therefore reparations.* The activists go down the entire list - housing, healthcare, education, prison systems, median household income, and claim that no matter what policies are in store - black people are suffering ergo reparations. The outcomes always seem to point to one thing in your minds - systemic racism. There will never be another cause, another culprit, no matter how far away into the future we get. No matter how unrelated this culprit is - such as with crime rates.

They simply misread the situation, or take the wrong course of action in response. But these misgivings get swept in the lens of race. We literally have no room for examination in that scope. For instance concerning George Floyd, how is it not reasonable to assume that the cop believed he was dealing with an incoherent druggie that, if left with too little restraint, would eventually lead to a bad situation for the cops in terms of maintaining control? He still, regardless, should have let George Floyd breathe and that's why it's murder, or at least manslaughter (but c'mon, 8 minutes and 46 seconds is fucking murder). And why would this be his \"first kill\" if it was because of race, anyways? Why join the police? Why not just go Dylan Roof? Why doesn't the government or the majority demographic just decide to become that?

I'm 46 years old and went through 44 of those years without a racially charged bone in my body. I really did and do believe it's content of character, period. However, the last couple years I've witnessed what I believe to be open racism against white people. I'm not going to pretend I'm oppressed, as I most certainly am not. I can't imagine what black people were forced to endure from the time of slavery until the days of Jim Crow and beyond. What I am claiming is what appears to be the beginning of something very destructive. As I've watched this transpire I've been acutely aware that our predicament will only be cured by a significant movement of people of color that stand up against it. Swinging the pendulum in the opposite direction may feel good in the short term, but will only lead to an eventual backlash in the opposite direction once again. Are we really going to continue this ridiculous game over the melanin pigment concentration of our skin or are we going to start using these large brains in proportion to our body size?

You probably did a cursory google search on \"modern-day slavery in Africa\" in an effort to appear \"informed\" on the subject. Just like you, I'm in no position to affect what happens in OTHER countries. It's a foreign policy and diplomacy issue that's apparently too complex to resolve with a simple \"wave of the hand.\" There are specialists in the field better-suited to handle the problem. More important - and just like you, a regular citizen has no authority to impose their will on a foreign government. If citizens could stop slavery everywhere, most would EASILY end the practice. The fact you think I'm just supposed to show up and make demands only reflects your ignorance on the subject. You DON'T CARE about slavery in Africa or ANYWHERE ELSE. You're trying to distract the conversation with unrelated topics. The simple fact is that U.S. descendants of slaves and Congress are FINALLY having a conversation that at the very least increases awareness on the topic. There's no real expectation to pay reparations. The government's history makes it clear they have no intention of correcting America's original sin. The TRANS-SAHARA Slave Trade was a problem and another terrible practice, and it's possible that future action might be taken toward compensation for their crimes as well. It's likely you're COMPLETELY UNAWARE of the vast differences between both Arab and European slavers. More important, there are no Black American descendants of slaves residing in Africa. The few Black Arab communities in those countries can do the same thing Black Americans are doing in the U.S. regarding compensation. No one will hinder their effort. The U.S. has a history of paying compensation to OTHER groups, except Black Americans. There are those who scream \"let the past die,\" but COMPLETELY dismiss slavery and its lingering effects, legalized Jim Crow segregation, lynching, rape, torture, murder, theft of Black assets/property and racist destruction of Black cities and towns, open discrimination and denial of economic opportunity to Black Americans for HUNDREDS of years - ALL with no compensation for their suffering. These same people have the NERVE to criticize Black Americans for their lack of wealth, major problems in urban areas, high crime rates, and unemployment issues. Black Americans NEVER had the same opportunity to build wealth and assets the same as everyone else. More important is the fact that when they DID build wealth with what little they had, racist practices and hardcore racists DESTROYED their effort. This is more than simple reparations. It's acknowledgment and correction of the systematic effort to keep a specific racial group in the LOWEST POSITION in society that affects the group into present-day. What's the issue with correcting the past? If AFRICANS enslaved and treated EUROPEANS in the same unfair and inhuman manner, their European descendants would be SCREAMING for reparations. Also - do you tell Jewish Americans to STOP talking about the Holocaust? Their group received and still to this day receive reparations. If their descendants can keep the memory of their suffering relevant, then Black Americans can do the same.

Domestic workers and farm workers – jobs held widely by African Americans and women in the 1930s – were excluded from the new federal labor rights, from most minimum standards, and from Social Security. New Deal rights were even further restricted in the 1940s, when a major roll-back of labor law enabled states to put up legal walls against increased unionization. These walls were primarily adopted by Southern states, which had the highest proportions of African American workers.)

You’re feigning ignorance…or you’re simply too stupid for this conversation. Either way – you don’t want an honest dialogue. Racism is literally STRUCTURED in every MAJOR institution and social system in America - economics, politics, education, and every other social aspect of society that keeps Black Americans at the bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum. It’s INTENTIONAL and BY DESIGN. Whites are afforded much better opportunities than Black people in EVERY WAY. There’s no way you’re too stupid to believe that racism ended in America based on some half-ass laws from over 60 years ago. Overt, LEGAL racism and discrimination ended, but structured and institutional racism built into U.S. society over HUNDREDS of years never stopped for one second. The easiest and best example is the so-called U.S. criminal justice system in which Black Americans are disproportionately arrested, charged, convicted, and administered much harsher and longer sentences than whites. This is a common practice even when whites commit exactly the same or similar crimes…if whites even get arrested in the first place. Racism exists to this day, and is STILL part of U.S. society. It’s the reason that Black Americans make such a big deal of the problem. With people who claim there is no systemic racism, it’s easy to pretend NOT to see it because privilege allows them to ignore it. Anyway…you’re ridiculously disingenuous and dishonest in your statements. Right now - in the middle of a worldwide pandemic, Asians are clamoring about racism as if this is a new phenomenon that \"suddenly popped up\" because of a virus. For that to happen, there has to be ELEMENTS of racism - residual, systemic, or otherwise - for Asians to make the damn complaints in the first place.

Are you willing to just look the other way on that suffering?

It's dishonest and a complete lie to \"pretend\" as if Blacks and whites had the EXACT same opportunities and starting points in America. Whites NEVER had the same unfortunate experiences as ENSLAVED AFRICANS, Free Blacks, and Black Americans. The first 350 YEARS of America's existence was ALL about PREVENTING Black progress in America. How are Blacks the same as whites when it was ONLY Black people who experienced ENSLAVEMENT, Jim Crow segregation, and institutional and structural racism in America? If history were reversed, whites would be SCREAMING about compensation. The simple reality is that America has no intention of making up for its past sins...all while benefiting from STOLEN LAND from the Native Americans and STOLEN LABOR from enslaved Africans. If slaves and descendants of slaves don't deserve compensation and to be made whole, then neither does any other ethnic group with years of historical suffering. Does anyone EVER tell Nazi Holocaust survivors and their descendants they deserve NOTHING for their historical suffering? What about Japanese Americans forced into internment camps during World War II or native and indigenous populations killed and forcibly removed from their lands? All of those groups received compensation, and yet the consensus is that Black Americans descended from slavery deserve nothing.

I’m not nor will I ever deny the racism that my father and grandfather have historically faced, but I’m also not going to minimize their struggles by likening mine to theirs, because it’s not nearly as treacherous in this day and age. We can say “black people deserve reparations” (I am also genuinely wondering just how Japanese Americans and other demographics that were oppressed received reparations) but regardless if it is right or not, it is just not viable. How would we successfully ID anyone who has ancestors who owned slaves? Did you know that even in the south, a minority of white citizens owned any slaves at all? Also, you realize that white people who had slave owning ancestors are generally in the bottom bracket of white people in terms of economic success, right. How would they be able to pay for reparations when they’re receiving checks from the government. And let’s not forget about the statistically significant amount of white people who are second, third, or fourth generation Scottish, German , French, etc. in america that by and large had no bearings on America during the slavery period. How do we account for that? How do we factor the amount of successful second, third, or fourth generation Africans Americans (Nigerians are easily the top economically successful group among American blacks) who had no bearings on slavery. We gonna mandate a 23andme test for every American (as if it’s accurate)? Who’s going to carry this mandate out? The government that’s as efficient as a sedated sloth?

How many generations of living black Americans should recieve the repiration? I knew a guy back home in Chicago, named Soloman. He had 13 kids. Do all 13 of them get the money as they come from a lineage, potentially, I think he was Jamaican, that qualifies? As far as what we can do about bad people do bad things I have an answer that not many people want to hear, so I'll keep that for later if you ask. But affirmative action has been around for 22 years. Something has been done about the job issue. There aren't any, in name, historically white colleges that I've ever heard of. The term \"historically black college\" has it's own recognized acronym. There are so many scholarships and Grant's specifically for black Americans that I would be guessing but I'd venture to say more per capita than for other races. If you hate this please let me know.

Fact is that that very few Southerners owned slaves, and the South was the primary benefactor of slave labor. Perhaps the Confederate states should pay the reparations since that's who benefited monetarily and that's who had Jim Crowe laws. Maybe reparations should be sought from the country that sold the slaves to the South. Where does this end? It ends when people realize that no one owns you and no one owes you anything.

Coleman can make points about Blacks being against certain things, but what race has a consensus on anything.  There are white people who are ashamed to be white based on the actions of some who represent their race. However, I am a proponent of reparations to build Black communities. Most Blacks or anyone for that matter should never receive checks because that won’t help the bigger issue. Since we don’t have a home “country” to build up, we deserve the opportunity to build our own space, just like other races. Systemic racism is real and this young man just hasn’t had it hit him in the face yet. It’s more about economics than race. There has to be a lower class in society and Blacks are it. If we built our own and not try to get white approval we would be better off.  Civil Rights killed our economy and led to us losing our sense of self.

Culture shock is real, feelings of not belonging is real.  Sowell goes right to the stats and ASSUME that their lack of success was due to them not being smart enough. Again, never said the stats were not real. Sowell is a well accomplished bot, who sees that your house burned to the ground and then says based on research conducted in small villages in Brazil, it has shown that fire burns down houses.

The economic exclusion has effected all Black people alive, young and old even if they have a \"fair shake\" in the present time, which is actually an incorrect assumption in itself. Let me unpack that as well, the wealth that could have been obtained and built upon by Black People while this economic exclusion took place would have put us on a stable foundation as a people.

So,  over 300 years of free labor, or slavery, constant discrimination all the way up to the civil rights movement and even now, which even after the civil rights bill was signed,  there  needed to be  laws like Affirmative Action and anti discrimination work laws, and housing laws just to get it to a remotely fair playing field, but yet, Coleman thinks we should forget the past, and that everything is fine despite economic inequality and  wealth gap between whites and blacks in this country .  Even the countless atrocities, and massacres and hate crimes that happened just in the 20th century such as 1921 Tula Bombings, 1923 Rosewood massacre, Ocoee Massacre, Bogalusa Labor Massacre, Elaine Massacre, 1919 Riot in Chicago, 1914 Ludlow Massacre,  1910 Slocum Massacre, 1908 Springfield Massacre and the Tuskegee experiment,  just to name a few. .

It means something different to many people.) is only a way to crystallize vengeance, to legitimize a desire to place blame and to circumvent the acceptance of personal responsibility. For a lot of people this is really more so an emotional issue, like a vendetta. These folks think that the greatest force for determining their futures lies in the hands of someone else and not their own. There are many American descendants of enslaved Africans (ADEA) who through determination, perseverance and commitment to the values of faithfulness, education and hard work have \"repaired\" the damage done by the legacy of American slavery and continue to construct their lives daily. Today the perpetrators of that which would destroy the ADEA community are not slave owners but those who would put the program of self-determination into the hands of someone else and not in the hands of those who, more than anything else, need to see themselves as creators of their own future. I believe the majority of  ADEAs aren't looking for \"reparations\" from the government.

My goal is clarity and truth in good will.  Firstly, who is \"we\"? Are you speaking for all ADEA? That's presumptuous of anyone one to say that they are acting as a spokesperson for millions of people they've never met and never respectfully solicited the opinions of. That is an assumption that borders on insulting the people you are claiming to speak for. Did you ask their permission? Did you solicit their point of view? You never asked me. Do you think that I don't belong to the category you consider to be \"we\"? If you'll notice, in my comment, I said \"many people\". I said that because I've either heard it said or read the viewpoint of \"many people\". There's no claim that it represents all people of whatever category you wish to name. Secondly, are you in poverty? Are you not living like a human being? If any of those things are true about you, you have my true sympathies and compassion. I would do whatever is possible to assist you in changing your circumstances. A relevant analysis of whether your circumstances are attributable to \"slavery\" and racism or any group of other factors would be appropriate in order to compose a relevant remedy. People, of any background and color, can and do, live in poverty for any number of reasons. Don't assume that when it comes to ADEAs that it's always slavery, jim crow or racism. When you do that, you insult the potential of the people you're claiming to speak for, oversimplify the situation, miss the real cause and waste time and resources attacking the wrong issue. I know that you don't know me, but I grew up poor, in the south, from a broken family as did my siblings. None of us is now living in poverty. We are all well educated, working and caring for our families. I do, however, live close to areas that are populated by folks who are vulnerable, barely subsiding and largely dependent on others and social services. I see them everyday. My heart is with them, but what they need is not government reparations. What they need is a reparation of the soul. They need to know that their destiny is not predetermined by their history but that they have the power within them to construct their future, if they are willing to reconstruct their idea of who and what they are. But, many will not leave the \"plantation\" in their minds. Not all but many. Also, who would that debt be paid to? Those who were enslaved are not here. You said \"we\", so that includes \"you\". Do you believe that you are owed an overdue debt? Now realize that you have been born into a world of opportunities that your ancestors never dreamed of. I don't know, but there's a good possibility that more money and wealth has passed through your hands than your ancestors ever came close to having. So what is it that you have been deprived of because of slavery, Jim Crow and racism, that couldn't be attributed to a myriad of other factors? Do I believe that there was a measure of wealth that should have been paid to formerly enslaved people, which their descendants would be owed? Legally, yes. But, it's a debt that can't be effectively repaid. The best thing the government can do is repair itself so that it can foster equal opportunity for all it's citizens. We have an opportunity to rise above our history, to show that the humanity within us dwarfs the inhumanity shown to our ancestors. For those who need help, we should help each other.

I'm aware that the viewpoints we have were not constructed in a day, but over years and with the input and processing of many incidents, interactions, things we've read, things we've been told, things we've experienced and so on. I'm aware that whatever we believe is processed through the lives we've lived and that's going to be different for every human being. I think it would be naïve and unwise for any of us to disrespect anyone else's life and point of view by dismissing what they believe to be true. I believe that general principles that we regard as true for other human beings are true for ourselves as well. With that being said, I also believe that \"as a man thinketh, so is he\". In other words if one believes they are helpless, regardless of what resources and opportunities they actually have, they are effectively helpless, because they will not believe in themselves enough to take advantage of what they have been given. My belief is that the most essential and powerful things a person can have are not material and can't really be given by another human being. They are bestowed by God,  but if that individual doesn't know or believe that and are unfamiliar with their gifts, they will always experience life as a victim, and perceive their lot in life based on what someone else did or didn't give them, or did or didn't do for them. I've seen countless stories of individuals, even those who were enslaved and didn't have a fraction of the opportunities we have today, who took control of who they were going to be in this life, regardless of their circumstances. The wealth they acquired may not have been monetary, but a richness of soul, life, purpose and character that money can't make or buy. My first contention is that in the reparations debate, many, not all, but many people place the idea of monetary wealth over that of character wealth. The latter (character wealth) can produce the former (monetary), but the former does not produce the latter. For me, the fact that this goes unaddressed in most reparations debates is evidence of a lack of understanding regarding human nature and evidence of a response to slavery largely from emotion and not from a place of understanding (understanding not just in an American history context but a human history context. America is not the only country that these things have happened in and it's not just an \"American/European/African\" phenomenon. I too want the best for any American person who is the descendant of enslaved Africans or anybody who has been unfairly discriminated against based on their skin color, nationality, etc., but  I contend that if we don't view it in a larger context and devise a remedy based on knowledge and understanding (as opposed to emotion and negative reinforcement) we will only extend the problem and create another avenue for it to travel in. Interesting factoid: I still have relatives who live in the house built upon the land that the plantation owner gave their ancestors when they were freed. To this day, no indoor plumbing or toilet or electricity. In Lawrenceville, VA, where I grew up. My great-grandmother who lived to 106 still made lye soap outdoors in a big kettle pot, burned wood for heat in the winter. They could have moved out, but they chose not to. They were used to it, learned how to enjoy life with it and saved a bunch of money cause they didn't have bills :-)  Obviously that ain't for everybody. I don't want to live like that. All I'm sayin is that we've got other more important work to do to better the lives of our kinsman than reparations. We don't need anybody's money in order to respect ourselves, treat each other with respect and dignity, keep our communities safe and clean. There is more than enough money in our hands to build, revitalize, construct and uplift. Money isn't the problem. The problem is something deeper where money can't reach. Every group of human beings, somewhere, have and still do face that. It just hits different groups harder at different and particular times within the thousand upon thousands of years of human history. Only difference is that THIS...WE are inclined to take personally. I've gone on enough. Thank you for reading. I commend you for your compassion and willingness to champion the cause of others. Keep fighting a good fight and God bless.

In ancient times, defeated armies were enslaved and worked to death.  African enslavement of tribal rivals was, and still is, brutal and preceded trading slaves to outsiders (Arabs and, later, Europeans).  African men sold into the Arabic/Ottoman slave trade were marched across the Sahara and worked to death.  Many of them were castrated because eunuchs had a higher market value, even though castration often resulted in death.

It is not limited to cutting checks. There are many forms that effect land, housing, education, and more. 2ndly, research on what the solution needs to be done because if we had the answer systematic racism and opression it would not be still present. As in the first point reparations is a complex solution and the right version will take careful research to create. 3rdly I would strongly advise reading about the close relationship between slavery and the Black condition today. According to PEW, Whites possess 20 times more wealth than African-Americans so Black people are not on some equal footing at this point and some sort of reparations could help to alleviate that disparity.

If you were watching a football game and the Ravens were leading the Saints by 21 points would you attribute this \"disparity\" in points to \"systemic\" discrimination against the Saints? Would you need to dig into the past lives of the players looking for evidence of how they might've been \"disadvantaged\" or would you acknowledge the fact that both teams started the game _that day_ ( the present ) playing by _the same rules_  and that the Ravens were simply performing better? Would you need to consider whether or not the Saints quarterback had been abused as a child or did everyone walk onto the field having the same _opportunity_ to come out ahead? If the Saints quarterback had been abused as a child should their team be awarded points before the game begins? If so, how many points? Would Ravens players be justified if they felt they were suffering from \"inequality\" or \"injustice\" because of the unearned points awarded to the Saints? Would the Ravens still be starting the game on \"equal footing?\" \"Adversity scores\" at colleges all across the country mean that White and Asian students must score _hundreds of points higher_ on their SATs than other groups for admission. Affirmative action means that a White job applicant who's _more qualified_ for a job will be passed over in favor of another applicant who's considered to be \"disadvantaged\" based on ethnicity. \"Diversity quotas\" also translate into the exclusion of White people wherever they're applied. In fact, the application of the word \"diversity\" itself can be accurately understood to mean as few White people as possible in modern contexts. You can say the most horrible things imaginable about Whites today without any repercussions, ( including ¢aIIs to  v i 0 I € n ¢ e ) but any utterance of so much as a criticism of other groups will get you fired and ostracized. ( and often worse ) Every single ethnic group _except_ Whites are encouraged to openly express pride for their group and it's accomplishments, we all know what happens to Whites who would dare to do such things. This concept is taken even further through the shaming of children by the \"educational\" system beginning in elementary school. ( White children, of course ) Five year olds \"systematically\" have shame and guilt psychologically instilled in them by our educational \"institutions.\" While I definitely see discrimination occurring in our country today, it's certainly not the discrimination you're talking about.

If you were watching a football game and the Ravens were leading the Saints by 21 points would you attribute this \"disparity\" in points to \"systemic\" discrimination against the Saints? Would you need to dig into the past lives of the players looking for evidence of how they might've been \"disadvantaged\" or would you acknowledge the fact that both teams started the game _that day_ ( the present ) playing by _the same rules_  and that the Ravens were simply performing better? Would you need to consider whether or not the Saints quarterback had been abused as a child or did everyone walk onto the field having the same _opportunity_ to come out ahead? If the Saints quarterback had been abused as a child should their team be awarded points before the game begins? If so, how many points? Would Ravens players be justified if they felt they were suffering from \"inequality\" or \"injustice\" because of the unearned points awarded to the Saints? Would the Ravens still be starting the game on \"equal footing?\" \"Adversity scores\" at colleges all across the country mean that White and Asian students must score _hundreds of points higher_ on their SATs than other groups for admission. Affirmative action means that a White job applicant who's _more qualified_ for a job will be passed over in favor of another applicant who's considered to be \"disadvantaged\" based on ethnicity. \"Diversity quotas\" also translate into the exclusion of White people wherever they're applied. In fact, the application of the word \"diversity\" itself can be accurately understood to mean as few White people as possible in modern contexts. You can say the most horrible things imaginable about Whites today without any repercussions, ( including ¢aIIs to  v i 0 I € n ¢ e ) but any utterance of so much as a criticism of other groups will get you fired and ostracized. ( and often worse ) Every single ethnic group _except_ Whites are encouraged to openly express pride for their group and it's accomplishments, we all know what happens to Whites who would dare to do such things. This concept is taken even further through the shaming of children by the \"educational\" system beginning in elementary school.

I know this is YouTube and you can't expect a long formal debate but please know that I am taking the time to write this because the idea shouldn't be written off as _crazy_. At the very least it is crucial that this country acknowledges that the effects of slavery are still very much present. This claim is backed by much evidence. The reason why I believe that this needs to be acknowledged (I'm not saying you don't acknowledge it. I don't know what you think on that matter) is because the denial is in itself a form of racism. The persisting effects of slavery and Jim Crow laws is an undeniable fact. I'm not saying all Black Americans feel these effects directly but *many* do. The reason why the plight of the Black American (and Native Americans) is unique to the prejudice and discrimination of other disenfranchised groups is that they were enslaved and stripped away of all dignity and denied equal opportunity for hundreds of years by the United States Government. I'm not attacking white people in this comment or ranting about white guilt. I'm talking about what John Adams referred to as \"an evil of colossal magnitude\" committed by United States government.

Your point about African Americans who arrived after 1863 or 1865 (whichever year you want to settle on) is a good one. I actually don’t have a proper answer but it’s one I’ve considered. Yes, I think documentation would be a pretty important factor here just like it has for Native Americans who have received reparations (though I know that’s quite a bit easier because a blood test suffices as opposed to written records). I’m not sure how extensive the records are for Black American ancestry but I think it’s worth looking into. I’m certainly not an expert. You’re right about reparations being paid through taxes and thus being paid by citizens, which would further mean as you say “black American taxpayers would end up paying their own reparations”. That’s true, however they obviously wouldn’t be paying all of it because the rest of the country would be paying for it as well and the reparations would be going to a much smaller group. Basically I’m pointing out that the amount each individual Black American would pay would be much less than what they what would receive in money or benefits of some sort. It wouldn’t be much different than other federal taxes where everyone is paying taxes that go toward the federal budget but only certain groups benefit from various programs paid by tax dollars. I certainly see the hurdles you’re pointing and the whole thing is complicated and admittedly even problematic depending on how they ended up implementing the program. My whole point throughout this thread hasn’t been that reparations MUST be paid (even though I’m personally for them). I just wanted to point out that there’s a decent argument for the case and that the proposition, in theory, is a legitimate one worth debating.

The source of the slaves is irrelevant and the fact that other nations joined in on these atrocities matters not. It doesn't matter if you unwittingly purchase a stolen car. The car is still stolen property, will be impounded, and you may go to jail. This argument is not only flawed but it's also not in good conscience. \n",
              "\n",
              "\"The logistics of such an undertaking are going to be extremely complex, and will ultimately satisfy NO ONE.\" You can't possibly begin to make the claim that reparations would satisfy no one especially without providing some sort of evidence. Your point about the length of time past between slavery does nothing to contradict my point of precedence for reparations. There's no \"expiration date\" for precedence. Whether that precedence is grounds for reparations is a different story, but there is indeed precedence. The complexity of reparations is also not a rebuttal. Of *course* it would be complex. No one would refute this point. H.R. 40, the bill proposed in this video, would commission a group to study the effects of slavery on black Americans and further elaborate a case for reparations. It wouldn't actually grant the reparations. The argument over how complex it would be is not the argument we're having, it's a distraction. \n",

              "No one aims to \"erase the memory of the pain\".

If not all of it can be made good, can some of it be made good?  Can ANY of it be made good? Don't make \"the best\" the enemy of the good. We cannot possibly undo the damage done to African Americans and it would be in bad faith to say we could. As you say, not a person is alive today who was actually enslaved. Nevertheless, the damage is still there and there is back pay owed. This country was built on free labor and the compensation is long overdue. The argument for reparations is complicated and requires much longer discussion than a back-and-forth on a YouTube comment thread. This video barely scratches the surface of the matter.

I don't know if you think I'm trying to be mean spirited or just boring rude, but Africans were involved in the slave trade before the Europeans were after the fall of the classical civilizations, including enslaving Europeans. We  could do DNA tests and attach it to the members of ADOS in the right regions of Africa like I've seen many here wanting to blame slavery on every American, regardless of where the hell they were or when they were in America. The whole stereotype of Africa being backwards is not exactly helpful. The Malian Empire and Mansa Musa were no joke, but with empire comes these kinds of sins. When it comes to colleges we already have white and Asian kids having points deducted from their SATs to get more POC in, not to mention black colleges. To be totally honest college has become wasteful to all people at this point. The idea could have merit to a point but not as an endless benefit. Technical schools would likely be more beneficial opposed to the adult daycare college had become.

As I recall (keep in mind this is 4 months ago for me and I’m not going to watch again right now), Hughes was making an argument that because first-generation immigrants with black skin are more successful (?) than African-Americans who were born here, systemic racism must not exist because this shows that skin color isn’t a predicting factor in success… I hope I have that right, but please correct me if I’m mischaracterizing him, I could easily be. I’ll continue under the assumption I’m close to having that correct. \n",

              "…. I wonder if it would be safe for me to say (in the sense of something we can readily agree on) that we are complex beings. Society is complicated. Sociology is a complicated science. Success is the result of many different factors. We might crudely represent it as something like this: S = f0 + f1 + f2 +fn, where S represents success and f represents a sociological factor. Let’s say f0 represents black skin. And f1 is place of birth. Now, it sounds to me like Hughes is saying that for these two groups of people who share a common trait, f0, we should expect S to be equal for both groups. My original argument was trying to point out that Hughes is ignoring any and all other sociological factors, f1-fn. Most obviously, f1, where they were born. Even this one factor has within it many, many factors. \n",

              "I’ll try to name a few possibilities… a family with two parents… and very likely all grandparents… a childhood where blackness was the norm rather than an outcast… a childhood filled with familial and personally connected role-models who demonstrate a norm of wholeness rather than brokenness… a childhood in a location that doesn’t have the same multi-century history of slave and enslaver (here I include Jim Crow all the way up through today’s systemic oppression - oppression has a way of evolving over time to maintain power)… ancestors who don’t pass on the intergenerational trauma of slavery. (Look up gene expression - trauma can and is passed on)… I’ve heard and read from many black men and women about what they experience when they travel outside the US. There’s a sense of acceptance that is liberating. There’s isn’t the loaded meaning of black skin like there is here in the US. People engage with them differently, more freely. Imagine entire childhoods in these distinct environments. A childhood with or without an education system that see them as the norm or or different or less-than, one that teaches them little more than they were slaves… an environment in which all the advertising is directed at people who look like them… in all the stories, they are the heroes and the main characters… parents and family who are all employed and able to provide.\n",

              "These are just a few of an infinite complexity of factors just associated with childhood. Now imagine someone who arrives to “America” the land of opportunity, the place of dreams. The dream is fresh, completely possible. Those who grew up here have had their dreams crushed and taken away from them time and time again. And they’re raised by people who have been living that reality for generations. The immigrants might face some challenges but they’re still fresh and are able to make their way, despite the extra obstacles.\n",

You’re painting an awfully rosy picture of where they’re coming from… I mean, why did they immigrate if it was so good? I completely acknowledge that not every factor will be beneficial, favoring the immigrant. There are very likely factors that work against them. Again, it’s *complicated*. And this is *exactly* my point. Hughes oversimplifies two different groups of people, asking us to consider them the same because they share one factor, namely, black skin.\n",
              "\n",
              "Something that also comes up for me… Correct me if I’m wrong… But I don’t recall Hughes bringing up success for a white group. If, in fact, black skin is not a determining factor of success, as Hughes is arguing, then we should, according to his logic (which I hope I’ve been able to clearly show is misleading) be able to fairly compare to a group of white folk. Are immigrants with black skin as successful as white folks without black skin? Seems a fair turn to make. But what do y’all think…?\n",

Just in scanning, I was noticing many people making the assumption that this would necessarily mean payouts to individuals. My impression is that most people who have studied the idea of reparations would agree that paying individuals is probably not as effective as investing in communities. This is a way forward I support. Given gross income and wealth disparities, we need to invest in all communities struggling, but there’s a special need to work with those who are suffering the effects of intergenerational trauma and a long and ongoing history of oppression. I would include indigenous peoples in that too. I don’t know if this is part of the discussion, but I would also personally support some kind of program that addresses race education for white communities. Reparations, in my mind, needs to include working on the ignorance that maintains the oppressive relationship between whites and BIPOC. Because it is, predominantly, a white problem.

In a similar way science does try to conceptualize concepts like mathematics might which pictures a vibrant cosmos, Einstein and his dynamic way of expressing complex theories, and explains definitively the science behind the way the world works. I posit a world which has this kind of mathematical dimension which makes sense much like a combination of Sir Isaac Newton, Copernicus & Einstein/Lucretius. Lucretius was unique in speaking about the natural world, etc. Perhaps he is also foundational for the liberal arts and I do not need to reference a scientific or even scholarly paper in order to conclude thereby that he was onto something profound that touches upon Aristotle's precepts. To see the whole picture through various lenses, that is a profound expression of the what-is like a Martin Heideggar in his Being & Time. But if one reads Proust(!) SURELY he comes to some similar conclusions through a much more pleasurable means measuring out what he was doing which is essentially philosophizing in an Adorning way (forgive my pun!). And as again for mathematics I immediately think of music and Bach's Odes to Heaven. Mathematics has a beautiful simplicity by turns and I plead ignorance on many aspects of it yet having seen both A Beautiful Mind and Interstellar movies I can see that there is such a thing as complex astrophysics and mathematical models of such. Therefore I posit that you are right but that we need a multipronged approach to understanding the universe and coming up with complex Universal Theories which are somehow all encompassing and physicists further ought to look to further themselves through many means and lenses by collaborating with philosophers, artists, & mathematicians such as yourself. (Sorry if I went on any tangents here, but there is always room for improvement individually and as a society.) Perhaps Philosophy of Science through mathematical models is King and Philosophy of Religion through Music and Poetry ought to be Queen that sit on the Golden Throne of Heaven on, in, and around and ABOVE the Earth.

The slave trade started more than 150 years before the formation of the United States. Around 95% of the slaves did not go to the US (approximately 400-500,000 landed in the US, compared to 10.5 million approx that passed through the US).

              "Coates applies this exact type of reasoning, which pushes an idea of vicarious punishment. If you walk it forward even one step beyond what he described in his persuasive argumentation, it collapses entirely. If you want to apply vicarious punishment for the evils of slavery, something like 95% of the people who died because of the slave trade, died at the hands of blacks, from wars that ravaged the African continent for 1400+ years. For those who did not die, but survived into slavery, again, 95% of those in the Atlantic slave trade did not end up in America. Around 50% of the total slaves trafficked were traded to the Islamic world. Vicarious punishment is very ugly when you start getting into the details.\n",

              "On another comment thread, someone mentioned that the claim for reparations is founded in a promise at the time of \"40 acres and a mule\". This is actually compatibly with Hughes's idea. There actually *could be* a homestead provision by the US government that could in fact be implemented very effectively. Canada has actually done something similar to this with land given to native groups who have organized and petitioned. No, you wouldn't get free housing to be built on the land, but that certainly was never promised. A promise of land though, that is in fact something that could be implemented and would be a very powerful answer to antagonists of reparations. The fact that the promise was made and it is in writing and although it has expired, as have all/nearly all other forms of homesteading offers is a minor hurdle to overcome. There is actually sufficient land available that could actually work to answer both sides of this argument without having to delve into dangerous ideas of vicarious punishment.\n",

Black people are no longer engaged in farming, but this is a major foundation of what was promised to them and what could provide them a sense of ownership.\n",

It would do nothing to build community and build future opportunity for wealth.

Of the arguments made in this video, Coates arguments crumble under even a casual level of scrutiny, even to the point of self-defeat. Coates is a proponent of the 1619 project, which extends US government responsibility beyond the simple formation of the US government. He applies an argument to the responsibility of the US government that it applies beyond a single generation because it is not a human (which itself can be overturned when examined at a deeper level), but he's tripping over his own argument because he's also trying to say that the responsibility of the US government extends nearly 200 years before its own formation. The US government has only existed since 1789 and ended slavery in 1863. That's 74 years of responsibility. More than 150 years of maintaining and refining a legal system towards a point of equality. If you want to include back to 1619, then you discard your own argument that the responsibility is to be borne by the US government as a discreet unit.\n",

And they completely collapse if you look at it in moral terms. He offers no real solutions as to how to apply any of this forward in a way that provides meaningful benefit.

Or rather what does that say about our educational system in general? That America places so much emphasis on the college education is something Obama I believe stressed in his last term in office. The emphasis therefore should not be on getting a solid college education but rather on getting an excellent kindergarten education such that a child can have a firm foundation. The education system should not base its decisions on whether or not a child is multicultural or well educated from an early age but rather on whether or not the child is multilingual and prepared to face a globalized world. My thoughts are still evolving on this matter...Coleman however represents a very highly intelligent POC and by turns has an elite ivy league education under his belt. His opinions therefore on influential and intellectual matters is going to be vastly greater than the average Joe. Thereby I might conclude that he is exceptional as an individual and am simply hoping for more exceptional individuals in society advocating not for what is easy but for what might be considered hard and for what is right. Education is not necessarily valued in our society as a whole. But what do we as a society value if not football, what do we call our national pastime if not baseball, what do our black men aspire to be if not basketball stars. How do we inspire the next Barack Obama? We value an elite education in young poor blacks, or those who are \"doubly disadvantaged,\" and thereby elevate the game. Coming from the elite boarding school background I know firsthand the advantages one gets from that kind of an education. My parents like Coleman's parents truly valued the nature of an elite education. So then how do we inculcate that thirst for that sort of education in our youth? We change the narrative of what is valued in America. I think this message is getting across nowadays to young people that the sky is the limit in terms of education. But the young men and women who can reason like Coleman are what we need more of today. They are our Superheroes! I expect great things from Coleman and others in time and I will expect great things from all of us in forming a more just society.

I agree that a meritbased educational system is perhaps ideal in America and yet as noted earlier the disadvantages are such that not necessarily a leg up but a push up is what is needed now in terms of educating young blacks. Not in the vein of W.E.B. DuBois mind you but in the vein of a Coleman. A young man of poetic sensibilities should be given special marks yet the situation is made more complicated by not having the ability to stand upon the shoulders of Giants. That is that without accumulated wealth these young blacks in order to become true artists and connoisseurs and commentators and dignified Lord Hastingses need some form of wealth on which they can rely while they set out on their journeys of finding themselves to be the true sages that they can be.

This is when a child needs and the parents should try to get the best educational foundation possible for their child.

But because we had to escape, we did have to start over. That was decades ago and I still see reminders of that every day. I’m surrounded my people my age that have extended family here. A network of support. Which is really important. Financially for one. I see people inheriting money, cars, houses. There’s always someone that’s going to be ahead of you. I had to pay my way through college. Then I spent 2 years getting into my chosen profession. Along that journey, I went to school with and worked along side people of every possible ethnicity, background and economic situation. The playing field seemed pretty level. You work hard, get the grades, you get OSAP and bursaries and you work a job, and you graduate. I made minimum wage until I was in my twenties and then a couple bucks more until I was 28. I took the bus to college, transferring 3 times along the way. I could have felt sorry for myself. Instead I used that time on the bus to read books or do homework. There are also many programs for immigrants, minorities and women to make sure they have a fair shot. And now women for example are outperforming men in college and female enrolment is higher. It’s hard to say if the playing field is 100% level. If it isn’t it’s pretty damn close. It’s definitely easier to get ahead of you have money. That I get. And racism still exists. But how exactly does the oppression you’re talking about stop you from going to school, getting a good career, and then moving anywhere you want to? My biggest actual advantage is that I have a father that mentored me and guided me. That and my ambition. If minorities are so oppressed how do you explain the success of East Indians for example. I own my own web design agency. When I post a job for a web developer, half the replies are minorities. Many from third work countries. They’re out there hustling and kicking ass. I just hired one a month ago through a recruiter. His name was Shawn and I hired him without even knowing what her looked like or what his background was. I liked his work and his resume. We spoke on the phone and he sounded like he knew his shit so I hired him. Many web developed didn’t even go to school and are self taught, and don’t even live in North America, yet they charge $40 - $80 an hour USD. Which has enormous buying power where they live. The work force has gone global and gone remote. You can do anything you want from anywhere you want. You can start you own company with no money. I started a second business with nothing. It casts me $32 a month to maintain the Shopify site. That’s it. And a couple of sales a month cover that. There’s no risk, no one standing in my way, and none of it has anything to do with my race, appearance, heritage, history etc. Many decades ago the Jews were actually oppressed and weren’t allowed to own land. So what did they do? They didn’t complain. They became doctors and lawyers and bankers instead and now they run the world. I’m seeing this happen again with third world countries seeing this amazing opportunity and they’re taking it. One guy I worked with recently is charging $15 an hour to build websites. He lives in Pakistan. That’s probably like $100 an hour there. He’s killing it. I don’t know if the world is 100% fair or if it ever will be. But there are crazy opportunities out there right now that anyone that’s willing to work hard can take advantage of.

I believe the difference between the two group is obvious. They just haven't been made to endure the atrocities ADOS have had to at the hands of the American government and the American people. ADOS have historically been mistreated not just physically but also mentally. We are witnessing the continual denial of their humanity. No group of people could endure this level of trauma without developing psychological  disorders. The fact that this issue can never be properly addressed because America is unwilling to admit the extent of wrongdoing it has committed against ADOS is yet another Tragedy. People who refuse to acknowledge the evil  that has been perpetrated against ADOS are akin to holocaust survivors. For  moral people,It's not even Debatable on whether or not ADOS deserve reparations. I think ADOS should work with the latin, Caribbean and continental blacks(the ones not brainwashed against other blacks) to build networks and share resources. If we can stay committed towards unity and not be dissuaded every time we encounter obstacles blacks all over the world could have some autonomy.

Ok currently the social climate in America is in limbo (the virus) there some Americans (blacks in particular) who feel- aided by the leftist agenda that their targeted/ neglected etc & that much more needs to be done otherwise it’ll suggest that it’s still representative of racial divide. Guess which side I’m on.. yup you guessed it.. it’s nonsense. Fact is there many factors that highlight why blacks in particular are effected (minus the hyperbole) eating habits/ weight average & at times living conditions, however sad & unfortunate in this reality, it’s no excuse nor should it just rest on rhetoric. What’s my point: I’ve come to find that no matter what the issue is (among blacks) they’ll be some who accept reasonably what it is & other who don’t. This who don’t (encouraged by the very system they seek to over throw) always find it necessary to scream foul, it’s not fair, XYZ needs to happen in order to get to XYZ. With a minority population I’m surprised there blacks who think/thought of reparations as (idk) a path to solution.. not all blacks want the same things yet some think they should b/c there surrounded by a minority of a minority (I think the term is vocal minority lol) who say hell yea. Blacks don’t want change.. they juts want to make a point about change. To have there grievances on record, to finally set there curfew like 18 hrs olds during summer break.. this is the real pride. Your free your no longer a slave & a citizen in the greatest country in the world & all you can think to say is it’s not fair. Blacks (some) are so easily seduced the very basis only this topic showed that. The dummies out the bunch jumped for joy & actually thought I’d they pointed out aka exhausted the talking point that maybe the country will make a fund avail as they did recently with $2T. Good luck with that. Stay mad until your blue or brown in the face or maybe (just maybe) you’ll come find greater meaning in all this. America doesn’t necessarily have the best history with this subject but i wholeheartedly feel there have been great strides in fixing it.

The pre-eminent philosophy of science is called Falsification. Because inductive logic, on which science is based, can’t offer certainty, it’s conclusions can only be said to have not been falsified. Only those hypotheses that have resisted falsification contribute to the body of scientific knowledge. The idea of a fundamentally true conclusion is one that is explainable through many different fields of study. For example, the idea that there is much variation in the human race can be demonstrated by the statistics of personality psychology using the Big Five model. It can also be explained by reference to biology; how variations  in genetic material occur largely through mixing in sexual reproduction and recombination. DNA behaviour is governed by chemical bonding, which in turn is dictated by atomic behaviour etc. The agreement between different areas of study is known as Consilience. The idea that Disparities exist in nature is almost an axiom. The idea that everyone is exactly the same isn’t based on scientific observation, it’s based on political ideology and an incoherent ideology at that. Adherents to the ideology like to blur the line between equal treatment under the law and equal outcomes.

That's cute - you think reparations is dividing America. America has been divided based on race since the 1600s. The entire country was BUILT on race and separation where ONE race benefitted tremendously over Africans, slaves, former slaves and their descendants. Racism is built INTO the very structure of American society. No one of European descent disagreed when European immigrants received ALL that free land in the early 1900s...and they were NEVER slaves in America. Now that present-day descendants own over 90 percent of America's wealth and resources, there's plenty of whining about how Black Americans and descendants of slaves are owed nothing. 1900s European immigrants received benefits that even former slaves and their descendants NEVER received DESPITE providing FREE LABOR under insufferable conditions of slavery. Europeans have ALWAYS benefitted above and beyond former slaves and their descendants. Europeans ALREADY benefitted tremendously both during and after slavery. Early 1900s European immigrants ALREADY got awarded FREE land LONG before former slaves and their descendants. Dr. King had something to say about that.

Since we know this events has affected AA community till today, so tell me again why they don't deserve reparations? Where is the stats you refer to that refutes this? Even Coleman states that the greatest sin was leaving the AA community to pull themselves up by the bootstraps. They still accomplished this and they were massacred. The human being is complex and many factors contribute to their success or failure, therefore stating that a factor may explain some parts of an issue does not mean it explains it all. People refuting reparations are simply not looking at the facts. Also, I'm not even leftist or liberal but I know right from wrong. What does virtue signaling have to do with the point we are arguing? Give me reasons, you can virtual signal and still be correct with your point. I am being unapologetic because the issue is for too long to uncomfortable to bring up by black people because they judge them immediately as not hard working and trying to feed of the government.

Also - the way to fight racism is to stop the actual practice by those who implement, support, and reinforce racism. It's actually pretty easy by way of laws that direct punishment, but laws are meaningless without enforcement. The biggest issue is that racism is literally BUILT into society - it's structural and institutional. That's the automatic racism that exists as a result of slaves, former slaves, and Black American citizens NOT having  equal opportunity to build and accumulate wealth, political power, privilege, and being met with laws applied unequally and in a biased manner. Criminal Justice has NEVER been applied equally to ALL races. These issues persist well into present-day. Black Americans own very little wealth and resources where as the dominant society owns almost 90 percent versus a paltry 2 percent for descendants of slaves. The time to make correction is ALWAYS open. The fact the country waited until hundreds of years later is a basic tactic to AVOID the responsibility to ensure compensation.

If you and your group posses legitimate historical records, supporting documents, and/or treaties - it's possible to submit claims for reparations. Lots of folks are claiming fake Native American ancestry based off their so-called \"family history\" or fake documents.

In the release, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell pointed to the President’s “continued commitment to reconciliation and empowerment for Indian country.\" The settlements help resolve more than 100 lawsuits totaling more than $3.3 billion brought by Native individuals and tribal governments – and spanning more than a century of alleged mismanagement.

Most Black Americans who fit the same description have the same or similar evidence. It's very difficult to fake African ancestry with DNA proof. Notably, most Black Americans who are descended from slaves can only trace their ancestry as far back as 1870 based on former slaves being listed by-name on that year's census. A few families can trace earlier lineage, but usually through other documents that include receipts and bills of sale by slave traders and their logs. With 50% Native DNA and supporting documents, it's a issue you and your group might want to challenge the U.S. government on why they refuse official recognition to your people.

DNA is a start, but your problem seems to be approval from Native American councils. President Obama put lots of effort into solving Native claims during his eight years in office, and was one of the few presidents to even consider settlements to long-existing lawsuits against the U.S. government. Tribes who are either lost due to death or interracial mixing with other races are basically a non-issue to the government. You have to be alive and present to submit claims for compensation. Without surviving members of any group, it's easy for the government to count them as nonexistent. Most descendants of slaves can trace family history to the 1870 census, which is the first time former slaves were recorded by name in counting the U.S. population. Those are solid supporting records to trace history and lineage. If available, it makes sense for Native Americans to use the same method to prove ancestry.

Meeting the blood-quantum rule and officially recognized membership really should be the ONLY major requirements, but the U.S. government is not going to make it easy for groups who suffered under racism and domestic colonialism to receive compensation. It's been over 150 years since the end of slavery, but descendants of slaves STILL have NO reparations...and it's pretty easy to trace those documents going back at least to 1870.

Also - you're doing that \"thing\" where everyone else tries to benefit when a program is established SPECIFICALLY for Black Americans. The Irish were never slaves in the United States and they're descendants are free to pursue compensation from their former slavers. I'm sure Black Americans will have no issues with Irish descendants' pursuit of justice in support of their suffering, but it's not America's issue. Jewish people were never slaves in America, but they and their descendants received payment for their suffering in the Holocaust and mostly without issues or numerous obstacles. America's issue is focused on AMERICAN descendants of slaves, not everyone else. It's funny how suddenly \"everyone is Black\" when there's a financial benefit. I would propose a 45 to 50 percent blood rule that literally rules out all these \"fake Africans\" and everyone else seeking to further benefit from any reparations intended for descendants of slaves. I would also require supporting documents that reflect a direct line of parentage that confirms slavery. It's very easy for legitimate descendants to confirm lineage as far back as 1870, which is only FIVE YEARS after slavery. All this other bullshit...\"free healthcare,  student loan debt forgiveness, free educational tuition, free citizenship, social security\" has ZERO RELEVANCE to reparations. Workers pay into social security, all that other stuff is on your dime. Pay your own damn student loans and get a job with great healthcare or pay for your own care. Reparations is a DEBT OWED for damage and suffering - it's compensation. As far as getting a vote...notably, NO ONE asked Africans if they wanted to be slaves for 250 years under insufferable and tortuous conditions in America...consider that when you think whether \"U.S. citizens be allowed to vote\" on the issue. The best point you have is responsible use of the money, but smart folks are not talking about a direct check. Economists already calculated a number that goes well over 10 trillion...slavery got lots of folks rich, except Black Americans. Compensation can also exist with programs, institutions, education, employment, and polices that benefit ONLY Black Americans and NO ONE ELSE. That's a much better plan than direct payout - it's measurable and with proper implementation and supervision, you can see actual forward progress versus handing off checks...albeit some prefer cash payment. Bottom line - the U.S. should have PROPERLY handled this issue in 1865 and not have allowed open racism and discrimination.

The Native Hawaiians who it wasn't hard to figure out who was owed because as of 1920 ONLY 22,600 of them even existed. For Native Americans, they were never given full reparations they were owed. It would've cost too much (think trillions of $). Also, a VAST amount of the money they got was put into trust accounts controlled and mismanaged by the US government. I would say Native Americans benefited MORE from gambling as a result of land reform than the money they got from the government. ADOS say that the debt collectively owed to them is $5-10 trillion USD, once interest is accounted for, and they want a large check to cover it, among other things, like free tuition, Medicare-for-all, and affordable housing.

We can't, we literally do not have the money and 2.) No one would ever vote for it. Again, I don't think reparations should not be considered but asking for $5 trillion as a minimum is a total non starter. For example: In 1859, the total estimated wealth gain from slaves was $3.2M. If we say there were approximately 4 millions slaves at the time, that comes out to LESS than one DOLLAR per slave. If we adjust for inflation--according to ADOS--and we do the same calculation, every slave would be owed $1,250,000. You can now see how ridiculous both these numbers are.

Systemic racism was a very real phenomenon when there was structural oppression like Jim Crow laws. Systemic Racism is no longer a valid explanation of unequal outcomes. Which is why Asian Americans are now the richest demographic in America. The problem with systemic oppression as a scientific hypothesis is that it does not describe a world in which it doesn’t exist. In other words, it has no null hypothesis. This means that any isolated episode of injustice can be treated as confirmation. This is in fact the point of the idea. It is a distillation of Marxian systemic oppression filtered through postmodernist critical theory and it’s aim is to foster social warfare between classes with the aim of fomenting revolution. That is why you see the formation of CHAZ with the aim to found more breakaway polities within the mainland US. Once we start to apply rigorous science to the paradigm of systemic oppression, we start to see its refutation. You made the point about the wage gap. The same methods can be applied to most feminist claims like that of rape culture, which was actually a concept stolen from a sociological study of the power structures in a male prison. Again we can refute the idea of a current police culture that targets African Americans by simple reference to the numbers. In 2019 the number of unarmed African Americans killed by police was 9, approximately half the number of Caucasians and the arrest rates correlated with the emergency call descriptions of the suspects. Also statistics that show African American men commit vastly more crimes of violence thereby bringing them into contact with police in much greater numbers. What we have discussed is a total of 4 indicators of systemic oppression against gender and race minorities that are frequently offered in support of the idea that America is a hostile place for anyone not a white male: Asian oppression, the wage gap, rape culture and African American deaths in custody. All have been shown not to exist simply by evaluating the research and statistics. Already America looks a much more equitable place. There are many more accusations and just as many more refutations using good science. For example, the idea that African Americans are discriminated against for bank loans which is refuted by the fact that banks loan more heavily to Asian Americans than white Americans and that black owned banks follow these habits because African Americans are generally worse at paying back loans.

When I did a lot of reading on the subject 10 years ago or so, the statisticians were downplaying the difference by saying that most of the difference was due to \"non-gender related\" factors and only a few percentage points of difference were unexplained by those factors.  Are you going further and saying that all of the difference is explained by non-gender factors?  One of the supposed \"non-gender factors\" was industry type.  Specifically, statisticians pointed out that women tended to be in less well-remunerated sectors, such as education--and that, for them, was a \"non-gender\" explanation of the wage differential. To me, the fact that the fields that women tend to choose in large numbers are less well paid is an indication of gender-based wage discrimination. Maybe there is newer data that I haven't seen.  What is your argument that there is no wage discrimination? (2022-01-30T22:25:49Z)</li><li>@stacihilliard3761: @@montereybay8392 really appreciate that question! So from the things I remember most-definitely not all-of the differences in pay were explained, or rather could be explained by industry. Even men in female dominated industries tend to make less than the men in more male dominated industries. The latter half of your point is rather valid though-why do women dominated fields tend to earn less? That's something that I would want to do more looking into. When I think of the teaching vs engineering example the difference is quite clear to me-public education has never paid well to my knowledge. Is that because it's always been more female dominated or is it because schools are funded by tax dollars and we don't fund schools well enough to begin with? The most accurate way-and I admit I failed to do this-would be to look at the avg of male/female incomes across particular industries and do an apples to apples because i would suppose the avg female engineer would make more than the avg male school teacher. So to clarify do i think the wage gap doesn't exist? No. I would not be surprised if in many fields men tend to make negligible to significantly more money than their female counterparts. That being said, when the \"pay gap\" is discussed it compares across all industries which is at face value not the best. Generally speaking a cardiologist will make more than a construction worker, gender aside. So why compare the two if the easiest point to prove would be disparities in a particular job/field?

I know many of y'all on here are going after Brother Coleman, but I think that comes from a very emotional standpoint.  I love that he broke down the disparities within racial groups as well and not just between racial groups.  I believe that if this was the case with the Jewish people, there would be disagreements on reparations too.  Their reparations were paid while many survivors were alive and we're talking about reparations for us about 130 plus years after the fact and so I can see and and understand where Brother Hughes is coming from.  His eloquence has me rethinking reparations because he is right, even well off blacks will receive reparations but those black Americans who face the same injustices as descendants of slaves but are not descendants will still be left behind.  And we can't just be like fuck it, I'm rich now.  But I still believe descendants of slaves still need to get theirs.  And it's up to those who get something to lift up the rest of the community and the diaspora.

The descendants of slaves today surely must greatly outnumber the number of slaves themselves, just as the descendants from the slave owners greatly outnumber the slave owners and that wealth has been divided up, time and time again... it is for these reason, i recon reparations must be in the form of community investment  \"give a man a fish and he eats for a day, teach a man to fish he eats for the rest of his life\"  I think the most relevant and possible form of reparations to help the black community would be in the form of quality education programs, health care, trades training workshops etc. The USA is largely a pay to win system.

He does not however, at least in this clip, address redlining, when the data is there to substantiate it.

Given the fact that incarcerating African Americans to work on chain gangs became the work around for freeing them is certainly relevant to the disproportionate number of African Americans incarcerated today.   While the terms of the transaction have changed there is still a profit to be made.  For me, at least, in order for Coleman's argument to work the comparison would need to be made solely amongst African Americans first, because of their uniquely shared roots.  Having established this most fundamental common denominator, data could then be collected to uncover socio economic discrepancies amongst African Americans.

The criminal justice system is less punitive for those who live in less policed areas (BW theory) and can pay for better representation.

If you got rid of drugs and gangs in black communities and replaced them with jobs and opportunities you would see a drastic change. But the fact that it's reparations we are talking about means that America is paying for a certain wrong that was done, a wrong that no other ppl have a claim. So to give ppl money or to put money in their communities when they have not lived under the oppression that black ppl have had to live under is unfair. That is the exact problem with the civil rights movement and why many blacks still are treated unfairly almost 50 years after thst piece of legislation was passed. As far the civil rights bill is concerned a \"minority\" is someone is NOT a white heterosexual male. This means white women, gay white men Asian men and women, and Latin men and women are all considered minority. When the original bill was for blacks as they were aggrieved party. What happened shortly thereafter is that businesses instead of hiring a black minority they hired a white women or a heterosexual man. This watered the bill down and we get what we have today segregated schools, communities and so on. I'm not opposed to poor white ppl getting assistance, but to do that under the banner of reparations or alongside reparations flies in the face of the very reason they are needed. To catch up with the rest of society that didn't have to go thru slavery or jim crow and so on. MLK even said after it was all over that he feared he led his ppl astray.

I also seem to have understood the story better than you. I’ll say it for the third time: it isn't reparation. It is fundamentally unlike the thing we’re talking about. This was not a claim for redress made against the United States government on the basis of some sort of culpability in the Holocaust. It also wasn’t symbolic. Nor was it petitioned for in the name of identity-group equality. You're redefining the terms of the discussion to make the extraordinary money-grab you’re after seem more typical than it is.  You're expanding the definition of \"reparation\" to mean any amount of money paid to anyone, for any reason. You're not comparing like with like. And I just saw you write that the amount of money that would have to be paid out to the descendants of slaves to constitute \"justice\" would bankrupt the country, so there’s a huge difference of quantity, as well as quality. What effect do you think such a heist would have on our country’s politics (not to mention finances)? You think feelings are bad now? You have no idea how bad it could get. This is a poisonous idea. And if this awful idea is meant to redress inequality, why should it be limited to black people? Only black people’s poverty is inherited? Black people’s poverty is the fault of slavery, and non-black people who are poor are merely feckless and undeserving? Why aren’t non-racially discriminatory anti-poverty schemes, however inconsistent their success, an infinitely more ethical, and less socially and politically corrosive option? And of course reparations is a handout – what are you even talking about? I know that what you mean by “equality” is equality of outcome. And “equality” that is compelled by legislating the transfer of money from one group of people to another, does, in fact, mean less for the former so that the latter can have more. How can you say otherwise? Only a very greedy and entitled sensibility could cause someone to deny these plain facts. Once the playing field is “leveled” in this way, as you say, what reason do we have to think that equal outcomes will endure? You should have listened more carefully to Mr. Hughes’ thoughtful remarks. It seems to be an article of faith with you that disparities in outcomes are primarily the result of overt or structural discrimination. This being your prejudice, if a massive money transfer to black people didn’t, in the end, permanently equalize outcomes, you would be convinced that this was because of that darned legacy of slavery again. The huge expenditure would have been for nothing, our politics would be an inferno, many black people would go back to demanding “justice” and “equality”, and the taxpayers who foot the bill and didn't even get any phoney absolution in return for it would feel very badly disposed toward the recipients. This is a nasty vision, and I urge you to rethink it.

Do you understand this? Seriously asking, because I wonder if you have any concept of where money comes from. Which brings me to Brett Arends' article which you posted a link for: I can tell that you either didn't understand it, or didn't even bother to read it. The author is showing how ridiculous the idea of reparations for slavery is; the tone of the piece is sardonic, and you missed that. He is explaining how a simple if arbitrary way of calculating theoretical reparations payments based on the returns of investments of sums of money equal to the market value of slaves aggregated over three antebellum generations produces figures that are absurd and ruinous. This is one of my points, if you'll recall. He goes on to show how the logic of reparations opens the door to even huger payouts, on increasingly flimsy grounds, to various identity groups, making the damage far greater. Another one of my points, if you'll recall. You really should have read the article. Finally, your silly attempt at a comparison between your race-guilt fantasy and actual legal personal debts is easily dispensed with. The hypothetical debt you cite as an example is a mere .025% of the net worth of the hypothetical debtor, whereas, the figure cited in the Arends' article for only slavery reparations, and excluding all other kinds, is by itself about three quarters of the entire GDP of the US. So there's that, but it's beside the point. Other than by being crudely racist, how would you even untangle which taxpayer is the debtor, and for exactly how much each? The situations are not alike.
