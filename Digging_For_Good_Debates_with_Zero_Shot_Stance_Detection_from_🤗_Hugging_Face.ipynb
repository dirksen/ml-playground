        "# Debate Mining\n",
        "\n",
        "When watching Youtube vidoes on hot-button topics, I would often deep dive into the comments section to look for good arguments and counter arguments. Youtube organize the comments section into two levels: top level comments that address to the video, and replies to those comments. Often I found good debates among these reply threads that brought fresh angles and insights. Unfortunately, Youtube's UI make it very difficult to dig up good debates:\n",
        "1. Youtube doesn't sort comments by the number of replies. I have to scroll and skip a lot of comments of zero replies just to access the reply threads.\n",
        "2. Not all threads present good debates. Many of them are one-sided, like mini-echo-chambers. It's time consuming to read tens of replies only to find out there isn't much debate going in the thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook attempts to mine good debates from the video comment threads, by using Youtube API to scrape top N most replied comment threads, and then use HuggingFace's ML model to rank them. It will render the threads at the end for easy reading.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Ranking Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to score each thread that reflects how good a debate the thread is. Based on observations, I found two indicators for a good debate:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Debate is like a tennis game: each side takes turn to present their arguments. The more rounds of back and forth, the more exciting the debate is.\n",
        "2. A good debate should also be balanced, i.e. the number of pro arguments and con arguments should be close. A big delta between the two indicates the debate is one-sided.\n",
        "\n",
        "Obviously, both indicators depend on the classification of each reply as either pro argument or con argument. This is stance detection."

        "\n",
        "[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is an open source data science and machine learning platform, like a GitHub for AI. It hosts many AI models contributed by others. In this exercise, I will use the [DeBERTa-Large model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-large) for stance detection. Given a claim and a comment to that claim, stance detection is to figure out if the comment is supportive, against, or neutral to the claim. E.g. giving the claim `the earth is flat`, comment `yes it is` is supportive in stance.\n",

I have a friend who in his early 20s he said he was going to have a sex change.  He had to go through 4 years of therapy, live life as a woman for 2 years before even being considered for surgery.  It wasn't until 1992 that she could put female on her driving liscence and passport. She is stunning even now in her 50's, but she had a horrible time, had been attacked both physically and verbally by men she rejected.  The problem we have now is that you don't have to go through any of what she had to, you can now just \"IDENTIFY AS\".  Recently I was in the shopping centre, I popped to the loo, there was someone in front of me, I asked if they were in a queue.  HE turned and I saw a bearded man with bright red lipstick and a bear gut.  I laughed and said he'd taken the wrong turn, the gents was on the right.  He came right into my face and said \"I identify as a woman\" . This person who identified as a woman in the women's loo, not attempting to use them was just standing there and perving.  I screamed and screamed until security came and took him away. Unfortunately there are members of our society who feel it is their right to abuse women and children which is why we fought so hard for  safe spaces for women, For someone to IDENTIFY AS female to go into a womans space and act like a man is objectionable .They do it under the guise of TRANS and so all are tarred with the same brush.

(<i>@L_Martin</i>)</li><li>(👍):@@L_Martin  Hi, I’m not interested in calling anyone a bigot. It seems that when your understanding of someone else’s position is questioned, your response is to merely re-articulate your own position, which in this case appears to essentially be a tautology. You reject the proposition A & ~A by setting A=“is a man” and that’s all well and good. The thing about tautologies is that they don’t actually have any propositional content; in fact that’s kinda their defining property. It didn’t matter what A actually meant, so the use of loaded language (e.g. insisting on male pronouns for transwomen) is ironically quite vacuous and not a genuine contention, however much you think it may express your views. Conversely, based on your description of what you think being transgender means, there is apparently nothing to reject because no objective truth claims are even being made by the ‘pro-trans’ position. Saying “X matters more than Y” is a value judgment with no power to mediate truth claims regarding X and Y in the first place, which is the practical function of a genuine supposition. I can’t think of a less well-defined position than one that asserts a vacuously true tautology for the purposes of denying an utterance without a truth value. It’s also important to note that the propositional question of clarifying beliefs regarding transgenderism is completely distinct from the social question of “accepting trans people”. For the same reasons that desegregation and criminalizing racial discrimination did not — and could not — “end racism”, your prior social acceptance of trans people says nothing about whether you actually understood what being trans meant, and furthermore what you think it means to say that trans people do not actually exist under any naturalistic description of gender. These are not empirical questions. So if you did once have a clear ontological conviction affirming trans people, what was the conceptual realization overturning it? I don’t become not-racist by suddenly not believing in racism by realizing that racism is wrong — some kind of bonafide conceptual intervention is required. So what was that for you?

But you can't explain WHY it's wrong because how do you describe something like that? It all adds up over years. I was fine  as a kid but then the thought of puberty made me feel physically sick, I thought that was normal because well it's puberty and everyone hated puberty.
