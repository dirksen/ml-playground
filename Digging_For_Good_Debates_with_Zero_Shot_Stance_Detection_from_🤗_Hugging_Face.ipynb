        "# Debate Mining\n",
        "\n",
        "When watching Youtube vidoes on hot-button topics, I would often deep dive into the comments section to look for good arguments and counter arguments. Youtube organize the comments section into two levels: top level comments that address to the video, and replies to those comments. Often I found good debates among these reply threads that brought fresh angles and insights. Unfortunately, Youtube's UI make it very difficult to dig up good debates:\n",
        "1. Youtube doesn't sort comments by the number of replies. I have to scroll and skip a lot of comments of zero replies just to access the reply threads.\n",
        "2. Not all threads present good debates. Many of them are one-sided, like mini-echo-chambers. It's time consuming to read tens of replies only to find out there isn't much debate going in the thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook attempts to mine good debates from the video comment threads, by using Youtube API to scrape top N most replied comment threads, and then use HuggingFace's ML model to rank them. It will render the threads at the end for easy reading.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Ranking Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to score each thread that reflects how good a debate the thread is. Based on observations, I found two indicators for a good debate:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Debate is like a tennis game: each side takes turn to present their arguments. The more rounds of back and forth, the more exciting the debate is.\n",
        "2. A good debate should also be balanced, i.e. the number of pro arguments and con arguments should be close. A big delta between the two indicates the debate is one-sided.\n",
        "\n",
        "Obviously, both indicators depend on the classification of each reply as either pro argument or con argument. This is stance detection."

        "\n",
        "[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is an open source data science and machine learning platform, like a GitHub for AI. It hosts many AI models contributed by others. In this exercise, I will use the [DeBERTa-Large model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-large) for stance detection. Given a claim and a comment to that claim, stance detection is to figure out if the comment is supportive, against, or neutral to the claim. E.g. giving the claim `the earth is flat`, comment `yes it is` is supportive in stance.\n",

Hamas has only been in existence for just under 40 years.  But nothing in all that time seemed to have any impact on the ongoing illegal acquisition of land by Israel.

It’s like going from the frying pan into the fire for Palestinians.  But on reflection, I think we can draw some comparison between Hamas and the IRA. The IRA was the military wing of the political party Sinn Fein. This party was against signing the Treaty with Britain in 1922 which allowed Britain to retain Northern Ireland.  They wanted to fight on for full freedom for Ireland.  A civil war ensued and the pro-treaty side won.  But the militants in the SF party never gave up the fight. Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland were not given equal rights with their Protestant neighbours (British settlers), similar to Palestinians in Israel.  There were different rules for both groups in society and less opportunities for Catholics to escape the poverty trap. When times were hard the Protestants blamed the Catholics and fighting between the two groups soon broke out.  When this escalated to extreme violence thousands of British troops were brought in to control the area. That was in the late 60s and they remained for almost 30 years. Meanwhile the old IRA reformed and entered into the conflict to defend the Catholic nationals.  They carried out shocking atrocities using bombs, and while the targets may have been military, the victims were for the most part civilian.  The whole story is too long to be told here, but the parallels between SF/IRA and Hamas are clear. Both fighting for freedom and justice, and both with a religious element.  Many Irish people despised them because of their actions and many more applauded them for standing up for the oppressed Catholics in NI, who had been totally abandoned by the new Irish Free State. The Hamas soldiers reminded me of the young lads who had joined the IRA  - they were up for the fight, but many of them didn’t have a clue about what they were actually fighting for. I see the same in the young IDF soldiers - all running on Mantras that have been drilled into them ‘kill the Brits’ ‘ kill the Muslims’  kill the Catholics’ \n",
              "‘ kill the Jews’ . It’s the same mantra, just different players. These soldiers are just minions. They will just do what they’re told.  When the IRA was eventually decommissioned in the late 90s, after a long, hard fought peace agreement was finally reached, the Sinn Fein party went on to achieve great success in the political field. They are the strongest party on the left, representing predominantly working class people, and in the last election in the south they got the highest vote in all the parties.  They have proven themselves to be very effective politicians, at least in opposition, but we still don’t know how good they would be in government. They have always remained true to their values, which is primarily to support the underdog, the downtrodden, anywhere. There is no religion involved in the party, except to speak out against abuse in the Catholic Church against children and women. I need to do more research on the political wing of Hamas, but judging from this clip, you would have to seriously question their methods of maintaining ‘law and order’  and that was during a period of relative ‘peace’.  SF also has no underlying hidden agenda, they’ve always said they want a United Ireland,  and everyone is welcome; black or white, Muslim or Jew, Catholic or Protestant, it doesn’t matter.  Hamas on the other hand appear to be fundamentalists, so maybe that alone rules them out to govern in a democratic society. But the same can be said for Israel.  Stalemate.\n",

On the Irish struggle against the British, my grandfather was born outside Belfast and left for Australia as a teenager and have always been interested in the history. There are similarities between the two conflicts but there are also some important differences. Ireland's links with mainland Europe and eventual joining with the European Union played a big part in the Good Friday Peace deal. Sinn Fein had to put down arms and cease bombing etc to get full European backing and once they had that the pressure on everyone for peace made it inevitable. Splinter IRA groups have attempted to literally blow up/kill the peace deal but they have been ostracised, convicted, shut down etc and even though there are still deep seated issues that cause problems, the peace has held. The Palestinians have no real equivalent, the countries of the middle east are often either at war or on the brink of it instead of being a united group, Iran only uses the Palestinians to increase their power and influence in the region, Qatar does the same and the list goes on.

This while Israeli has the most right wing government it's ever had with some cabinet members that are practically Nazis that would like to ethnic cleanse every Palestinian from the whole area(one of them said that nuclear bombs should be dropped on Gaza after October 7th). The events of that day have left such a wound on Israel that Hamas knew that it would lead a vengeful Netanyahu government to bomb the hell out of Gaza killing thousands while Hamas leaders sit in luxurious compounds in Qatar. Extremists on both sides are responsible. Even when a leader that works hard for peace gains enough power to make a start at peace, often a fanatic kills them (1995 Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin shot by right wing Israeli, Palestinian Fatah leader shot in 2006 by rivals in his own party).

It is not feasible for the 1948 refugees to return at this stage, but they should be compensated for waiving that right. The more recent illegal settlers should be moved away from areas where the majority are Palestinians, and recent refugees could then return to those areas.

The common theme is inequality and injustice, one section of society being constantly humiliated and persecuted. It is the key players that made the difference - some made it worse, others better.

Barricades were placed around Catholic areas so that had to pass through army checkpoints everywhere they went. The children were not allowed to walk to school by passing through any Protestant area, yet Protestant Unionists regularly held marches which took them through Catholic areas. This and many other firms of segregation are what lead to violence. The IRA increased the violence to a new level. Margaret Thatchers reign as the ‘Iron Lady’ fueled the aggression further as she consistently refused to enter discussions to try to find a solution. IRA members were regularly arrested and interned without trial. They began a hunger strike, the first non-violent action for change, but still she refused to negotiate, she outright refused to grant them political status, without having any discussion. Bobby Sands was the first prisoner to die. But it caused outrage in Irish communities across the globe, and Bobby Sands was elected by the people before he passed. At the same time, 6 Irish men had been rounded up following a bombing in the Uk by the IRA. They were innocent but convicted with fabricated evidence and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Partly due to the refugee crisis that the Zionist gangs had created, the surrounding Arab countries then attacked the Zionist forces that had just declared the nation of Israel. The Arab countries lost the war and 400,000 more Palestinians fled or were expelled. The new state of Israel did now allow the 700,000 Palestinians refugees to return and instead stole their lands and homes. Over the next three years, 260,000 Jews left Arab countries to settle in Israel. This was partly because the Zionists had created so much hatred in Arab countries by expelling 700,000 Palestinians that the Arab states starting repressing their Jewish populations, partly because Israel's Mossad was doing terrorist acts to scare Mizrahi Jews to leave their homes, and partly because Mizrahi Jews thought that life would be better in Israel. Then, Israel took the homes and lands of another 300,000 Palestinians in the 1967 war and again refused to allow them to return. The animosity caused by the 1967 war, which Israel initiated, caused another wave of Jewish refugees from Arab countries.

So the whole indigenous neo-marxist argument by palestinians, is bull#$*%.

Jordan and Aza were \"occupied\" by Jordan and Egypt respectively, yet there wasnt one cry of occupation for that 20 year period, and not one attempt to create a state of Palestine. \"Palestinianism\" is an Islamist supremacist movement countering Zionism.

A couple of points:  First, I see no indication that Israel is suffering economic damage it wasn't prepared for and can't handle.   The same appears true for Hamas.   It doesn't appear to me that economic factors are important, at least not at this time.   I might be wrong....let's see if this changes as time goes along.    Next; the Houthis have zero capability of doing Israel any real damage.  The PA in the West Bank has no military.   Most important, if it was in Hezbollah's interest to go all the way to full scare War, they would have done so by now.    Our strongest disagreement appears to be in regards to the relative morale of both the combatants AND the civilians on the respective sides.   I'm not a military expert, but what I DO know, with 100% certainty, is that the entire nation of Israel is apoplectically ANGRY.   As the allegations of rape and torture of women by Hamas on 10/7 become more and more verified, this gets even MORE extreme.  The IDF was caught napping on 10/7 and wants full revenge, like the US after Pearl Harbor.  If you don't think that Israel and Israelis are seriously PISSED OFF, then you're not in touch with what's going on.   OTOH, there is credible evidence, as reported just today (12/7) on the BBC, of Hamas fighters NOT fighting \"to the death\", but rather surrendering.  The same BBC report said Israel's advance into Khan Yunis was going faster and easier than expected.....surprising even the IDF itself.   Although the stated goal of \"eliminating\" Hamas is not achievable, as the leadership is hiding in Qatar, the IDF and is perfectly capable of making Hamas militarily irrelevant, and at the current pace, could just succeed in this particular objective before the end of the year.   I'm delighted to continue the discussion if you wish!   Have a great day.

Any of them can return if they want, but they don’t have a NEED to return. They visit. And they enjoy their Irishness.  Having the homeland there is what matters. There are two distinct differences with Palestinians - they have no recognized State (ie no homeland) and secondly, they have nowhere to go.  Some of the refugees from 1948 are still living in refugee camps, some have had to move to new camps.    There should be a Palestinian State for the people still living there, and Israel should negotiate with its Arab neighbours to allow Palestinian refugees to establish new communities where there are camps, and assist them to do so.

After my unbiased neutral research, as an educated American with lots of Jewish friends and zero Muslim or Arab acquaintances , I can honestly say that Zionism is horrible, the founding of Israel was despicable and the Palestinians have been abandoned by the civilized world.  Israel is a doctor Frankenstein that created the monster that is Hamas.  Palestinians have legitimate grievances and the US has abandoned its principles of democracy and human rights in support of Israel.  Rabbi Kahane, a Brooklyn Jew who went to Israel to take land away from Palestinians (incredible, people from Brooklyn take land away from some of the poorest and most abused people in the planet) said it best— Zionism is incompatible with democracy, and for there to be a Jewish state, the Arab Muslims must be removed, voluntarily or by force.

Then the UN sanctioned a Jewish state and the Arab countries again tried to dispossess and kill the Jews. Due to war, many Palestinians fled and some much smaller number were expelled (see Morris). And then 800,000 Jews were expelled or felt threatened in Arab counties and took refuge in Israel. No one is perfectly innocent here. But any reasonable history shows the Jews as people who tried to find safety amid centuries of persecution and were willing to share the land with 2 states side by side. The Palestinians and Arab countries were not. The excess settlements in the west bank are a problem and should be rolled back.

Of course the Muslim Brotherhood credentials were exposed when they gained power in Egypt after the Arab Spring led to the ousting of the military dictatorship and the MB leadership proved to be corrupt and inept. In the 80's when the PLO dominated the politics of Gaza, the Muslim Brotherhood through Hamas had a largely social presence through charities. It was the breakdown of partnerships between the PLO and the MB(the PLO leader Arafat had fought alongside the MB as early as '48) that contributed to Hamas becoming more political, which led to being more militant and conducting terrorism. This is in no way an excuse for the horrific violence over many years that the MB has been a part of, but to deny the social programs and charities they have also done would be wrong and a failure to accurately understand their history and support in the region. To try to work out constructive solutions without truly understanding the problem is pure folly. \n",
